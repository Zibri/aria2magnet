# Aria2 Magnet URI Resurrector

Have you ever found yourself in the digital wilderness, staring at a mysterious .aria2 file like it's the last slice of pizza at 3 AM? You vaguely remember interrupting a download, and now all you have is this cryptic file extension mocking your forgetfulness. Fear not, fellow data hoarder! Your torrent dreams are about to be resurrected.

## What is this sorcery?

This magical web app takes your lonely .aria2 file and transforms it into a magnificent magnet link faster than you can say "where did I put my external hard drive?" It's like a digital archaeologist, excavating the remnants of your abandoned downloads and breathing new life into them.

## Features

- Drag and drop functionality (because who has time for clicking these days?)
- Instant magnet link generation (faster than your cat's mood swings)
- One-click copying (save those precious milliseconds)
- Direct magnet link opening (we know you're impatient)
- No data storage (what happens in your browser, stays in your browser)

## How to Use

1. Clone this repo (or download it, we don't judge)
2. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser (or your least favorite, if you're feeling rebellious)
3. Drag your .aria2 file onto the page (or click to select, if you're old school)
4. Marvel at the instantly generated magnet link
5. Copy or open the link and resume your download (finally!)

## Why should I use this?

- It's faster than trying to remember where you found that obscure Linux distro
- It's more reliable than your memory after a Netflix binge
- It's open source (because we believe in transparency, unlike your fridge light)

## Technical Mumbo Jumbo

This app uses the latest in `string concatenation` technology, sprinkled with some `bitwise operations` for that extra zest. It's basically rocket science, but for your downloads.
